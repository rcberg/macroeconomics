# Macro- and Development Economics
This repository was initiated to store materials for macroeconomics and development economics graduate coursework at the University of Oregon.

## Mosquito problem solution

## Overlapping Generations (OLG) economy simulation
Below is R code which produces simulations of a basic 2-period Overlapping Generations macroeconomic model. The model incorporates a lump-sum wage tax during the agent's working period, which is rebated as a public good. The tax is set in such a way to make the economy dynamically-efficient.

## Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans (RCK) economy simulation
Below is R code which produces simulations of a basic Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans macroeconomic model. The model features a growing representative dynasty that lives to infinity, and plans as a single decision-maker. Features a shooting algorithm that numerically solves for the dynamic saddle path to the steady state. (This algorithm is fairly sensitive to model parameters.)
